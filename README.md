## TASK 1:  MUON MOMENTUM INFERENCE USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS
* Develop a Fully-Connected Network using a framework of your choice and evaluate its ability in classifying muon momentum ranges using the raw data muon data that we provided. 
## TASK 2:  IMAGE-BASED CLASSIFICATION OF MUON MOMENTA
* Similar to Task 1, this task requires you to implement a FCN and a CNN. Only this time, you have to project the hits provided by the raw data into images
